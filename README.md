# MouseJump
Move Jump is a simple Automator Programm that simulates user activity.

Keep sessions alive, Teams active and Interrupt screensavers/sleep mode - ideal for people who work from home.

Wishlist:
- Automatically pause Move Mouse when user input is detected, and resume when idle again.
- Apply blackout schedules so that Move Mouse only works at specific
times of the day.
